# Matching Network implementation in Keras
Implementation of "Matching Networks for One Shot Learning" in Keras

In order to train a 5-way 1-shot model run:
```
python matchingnetwork.py
```
Bonus:
Train a model with Full Context Embedding (FCE) defined as Siamese like pairwise interactions:
```
python matchingnetworkwithrelationalembedding.py
```
